# Nessus-Vulnerability-Management-Project


- Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts
- Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: 
- Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities 
- Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.

- Running both a credential scan and an uncredential scan is crucial to comprehensively assess the security posture of your system.
- While an uncredential scan provides a valuable external perspective, a credential scan, like the one executed using Nessus Essentials on my VM, delves deeper into the internal environment.
- By leveraging valid credentials, it uncovers vulnerabilities that might remain hidden during an unauthenticated scan. This dual approach ensures a more holistic understanding of potential weaknesses, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of your vulnerability assessment.
